<h1>Greetings traveler, and welcome to Julians programming experience resume.</h1>
<p> <p>
<h3><font color="green"> My experience with computers in general:</font> </h3>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------<p>
<p>  I have always had an interest in science and technology from an early age. Many independent projects I have worked on both during and outside my time at marlboro include...<p>
<p> - Raspberry Pi based arcade machine/game emulator <p>
<p> - Member of high school robotics team (competetive movement/puzzle based programming challenges) <p>
<p> - A lot of work with simple arduino devices (class with Jim)
<p> - Have wrote a moderate amount of basic javascript and html code (More classes with Jim)
<p> - Have a lot of experience with video game modding/emulation
<p> - Python projects I have done include creating a line plotter using turtle graphics and re creating Uno as a functional text based python game <p>
<p> <p>
<p> <p>
<h3><font color="green"> My most notable skills:</font> </h3>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------<p>
<p> When it comes to writing code my strongest skill I think is creating things that are based around topics which intersect with what my interests are. <p>
<p> I enjoy using what languages I am familiar with to crunch numbers, provide solutions to formulas, and automate things. <p>
<p> I have a large amount of experience studying the natural sciences under my belt and have a good grasp of useful mathematical concepts as a result. <p>
<p> (Things having to do with trig/real world algebra and other standard physics 1 concepts) <p>
<p> The programming languages I understand most are Python, HTML, and C. <p>
<h3><font color="green"> Plans as we move onward: </font> </h3>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------<p>
<p> My hope is that by the end of the semester I will develop a greater understanding of common web technologies and get better at working with others. I specifically want to improve my Python skills as it is a languange that has many applications pertaining to my academic interests. Object based programming is a particular perk of the Python language which I hope to master the usage of, among other things having to do with internet security/web development.<p>
